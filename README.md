## Hi there 👋

Industrial Engineer graduated from Universidad Autónoma del Caribe with a B2+ English proficiency level. I have solid expertise as Business Analyst, specializing in frameworks like Scrum (Scrum master certified) and Agile methodologies. 

My experience includes extensive work in requirements gathering, client management, and the creation of user stories to ensure clear and effective project deliverables. I have advanced knowledge of tools such as Trello and Azure DevOps, which I leverage to manage workflows, track project performance, and facilitate team collaboration. 

Additionally, I have experience using Power BI and SQL to generate reports and support data-driven decision-making. I focus on enhancing efficiency and delivering value through strategic planning and effective resource management.
